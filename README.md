🍰 Closure Cake Mix Animation – JavaScript Visualization
This project is a fun and interactive web-based visualization to help learners understand one of the most powerful concepts in JavaScript: closures.

🧠 What is This?
A visual and interactive demo using the cake mix + chef analogy to explain how closures work in JavaScript. Each time you "call outer()", a new "chef" with their own cake mix (count) is created. Calling counter() bakes a cake and increments that chef’s personal count — demonstrating how closures preserve state.
